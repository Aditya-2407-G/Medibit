# Medibit

Medibit is a React Native application developed with Expo and Appwrite that simplifies the process of transferring medical files to hospitals.

## Features

- Seamless File Transfer: Transfer medical files to hospitals by - scanning a QR code.
- Centralized Medical Data: Store prescriptions, lab reports, and other medical documents in one place for easy access.
- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-navigate UI developed with React Native and Expo.
